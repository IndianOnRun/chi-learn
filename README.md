# chi-learn

## In One Sentence
Given records of crimes committed in Chicago from 2001 to day x, can we predict how many violent crimes will be committed on day x + 1?

## Data
We're using Chicago's Socrata open data. Crime records can be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2). We export the crimes as CSV.

## Tools
So far, we're using _pandas_ to munge the data. We're considering PyBrain for learning a neural network.

## Origins
Chi-learn is Will Engler, Kevin Minkus, and Joel Roggeman's term project for Pitt CS 1675 (Machine Learning) Spring 2015 with Dr. Rebecca Hwa.
