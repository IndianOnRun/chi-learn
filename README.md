## Notes on feature binning

Will made a first stab at binning crime location and crime description into more manageable bins.
He used the bins provided at http://gis.chicagopolice.org/clearmap/crime_types.html to guide him.
Roughly, here's how they're sorted:
(homicide, manslaughter, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, aggravated battery) -> most  1
(burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, simple assault, simple battery, arson) -> severe 2
(Forgery & Counterfeiting, fraud, embezzlement, stolen property, vandalism, weapons violation) -> moderate 3
(prostitution, criminal sexual abuse -Not as bad as it sounds!- drug abuse, gambling, offenses against family, liquor license, disorderly conduct, misc) -> minor 4
